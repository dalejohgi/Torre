Torre Ranker is a web application to rank developers in Torre.co acording to the experience developing they have posted on their genoma.

To use it you just have to wtrite your username, and it will automatically rank your profile in different categories such as Baby-Dev for very junior developpers to Hero-Dev and God for very experienced engineers. The ranker will also give you an score. Every 10 points there is a new category of expertise.
